# pjwstk-algorithms-HeapQuickInsert

Task description: "In C write implementation of 3 algorithms: Heap Sort, Quick Sort and any other selected algorithm. Use at least 100 000 records in array to compare sorting times, between these 3 algorithms, for following data:
- random numbers array (same array must be used in each sorting algorithm)
- Max to Min sorted numbers array
- Min to Max sorted numbers array"

Array length is hardcoded (100 000) in "define" declaration above main method.

Compile and run - result will be printed in the console.
